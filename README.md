# Void Defect Detection for Extrusion-based Additive Manufacturing Using Machine Learning
### Manal Behih
## Introduction
This is my Thesis for my Master's, under the supervision of Dr. Sheng Yang with the University of Guelph.
## Description
The primary objective of this project is to develop a void detection
algorithm leveraging 3 Optimization Techniques with the assistance of Reinforcement
Learning (RL) techniques, with a particular focus on Q-learning. The algorithm aims to
train an agent to autonomously make decisions by interacting with its environment.
Through this interaction, the agent receives positive or negative rewards based on its
accuracy in detecting the correct regions within the provided labeled dataset with the
assistance of Intersection over Union (IoU), Loss Function and Gradient descent
algorithm Optimizer. By effectively identifying voids during the training process through a
Supervised Learning (SL) approach, this algorithm is expected to significantly reduce
printing time and material wastage, which can be substantial.
